/**
 * Middleware to track administrative actions performed via Telegram UI
 * (not via bot commands) such as bans, mutes, kicks done through right-click menus
 * or admin panels.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
 * - ✅ Ban detection (user status changes to "kicked")
 * - ✅ Unban detection (user status changes from "kicked")
 * - ✅ Mute detection (user permissions restricted)
 * - ✅ Unmute detection (user permissions restored)
 * - ✅ Kick detection (short-term ban with quick expiration)
 * - ✅ Prevents double-logging of command-based actions
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * - ❌ Message deletion detection via UI: Telegram Bot API doesn't provide
 *   deletion events. Would require admin permissions and complex workarounds.
 * - ❌ Duration/reason detection: UI actions don't include duration or reason
 *   information in the chat_member updates.
 *
 * This middleware listens for chat_member updates which are sent when:
 * - User is banned/unbanned via admin panel or right-click menu
 * - User is muted/unmuted via admin panel or right-click menu
 * - User is kicked via admin panel or right-click menu
 *
 * Note: For message deletion detection, consider enabling admin permissions
 * for the bot or implementing a separate system.
